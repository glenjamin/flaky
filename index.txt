npm install --save request async

Be sure to reference the docs npm.im/request and npm.im/async


make an HTTP GET request to /list

You will get a 401 with an X-Auth-Token header and a Location: /login

Make an HTTP POST request passing back the X-Auth-Token header
to /login with json of password = "supersecret"

You'll either get a 200 if correct, or a 401 if wrong

This will flag the token as approved, and you'll now be able to make requests
without getting a 401

Make an authenticated request to /list

You'll get a json list of paths back ["/page/1", "/page/2"] etc

Make a request to each of the pages in the response, and calculate an md5 hash.
See: https://github.com/glenjamin/nodeschool-stream-adventure/blob/master/fifteen.js

Now post back to the server on /verify with a json object of the numeric part of
the page to the md5 hash. you'll either get a 200 or a 400.

eg.
{ "1": "d0ce1e395418223e6a8d13815714e7cd" }
